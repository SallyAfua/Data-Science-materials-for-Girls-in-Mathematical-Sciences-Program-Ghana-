# Data-Science-materials-for-Girls-in-Mathematical-Sciences-Program-Ghana-
This material is my first teaching syllabus for high school girls in Ghana. The aim is to motivate them to self-learn coding, data science and machine learning. Hopefully, I will improve this skill and help beginners to learn how to code and do data science in computational notebooks without any hassle.
