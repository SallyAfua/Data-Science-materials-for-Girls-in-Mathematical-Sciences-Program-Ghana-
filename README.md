# Data-Science-materials-for-Girls-in-Mathematical-Sciences-Program-Ghana-

In this short course we will study how to use Python for data analysis in Jupyter
notebooks in a fun and engaging way. We will employ a hands-on approach to explore the four main
steps in data analysis, viz:
1. Importing data
2. Managing data frames
3. Data preprocessing
4. Data exploration and visualisation
At the end of the course, students will be required to present a mini-data analysis project in groups.


P.S.: This material is my first teaching syllabus for high school girls in Ghana. The aim is to motivate them to self-learn coding, data science and machine learning. Hopefully, I will improve this skill and help beginners to learn how to code and do data science in computational notebooks without any hassle.
